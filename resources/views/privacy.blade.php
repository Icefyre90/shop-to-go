About us
OneClickSocialLogin (“OneClickSocialLogin”, ”we”, ”us”) is a registered technology company offering a set of web-delivered tools and services for establishing and optimizing a site’s connection with many social networks and providers such as Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo! and LinkedIn amongst others.

The OneClickSocialLogin social optimization platform enables online businesses (“Developers”) to (a) easily connect their sites to all the major social platforms and integrate with Open ID and other external authentication providers; (b) offer their site visitors (“End Users”) on-site authentication, sharing and social features to enhance their connected experience; and (c) analyze a site’s social activity with helpful use data and metrics.

OneClickSocialLogin’s technology also enables Developers and their End Users to easily distribute web content applications such as photos, videos and other widgets (“Web Applications”) to social networks and a wide variety of other web destinations, and directly to mobile devices.

We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our privacy practices as they pertain to our website, OneClickSocialLogin.com (the “Site”) and subdomains of this domain. We also intend for this policy to inform you about our privacy practices as they pertain to your use of our Web Applications and services (collectively, the “Service”). This Privacy Policy applies to all aspects of the Service, whether made available or accessed via our Site, via the websites of our partners, via other third parties, or on mobile devices.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

1. Personally Identifiable Information
We collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) via the Site and the Service. PII is any information that may be used to contact, identify or locate an individual, and includes, but is not limited to, your name, user name, email address and passwords. OneClickSocialLogin generally collects PII under the following scenarios:

When you choose to provide us with your PII via the Site; including, when you send us an email asking a question, we use that information to answer your question and will store it for a reasonable time.
We may periodically publish an email newsletter. If you provide us with your email address for the purposes of receiving OneClickSocialLogin’s email newsletter, we may also email you with further information and offers from OneClickSocialLogin and/or third parties that we believe you may find useful or interesting. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided within the email.
The Service may enable you to send emails to your friends. If you provide your email address or your friends’ email addresses for these purposes, OneClickSocialLogin will store those email addresses, but will not use them to send promotional emails to you or your friends (unless you or your friends independently sign up to receive promotional emails from OneClickSocialLogin.)
When Developers and OneClickSocialLogin Clients register to use the Service via the Site, OneClickSocialLogin collects their name, company, email address, website URL and telephone number. OneClickSocialLogin also asks them to select a password for their account. OneClickSocialLogin uses this information to help maintain their account.
If you choose to use the Service via one of the many open standards for user authentication and access control (e.g., OpenID, OAuth, etc.) that enable you to link the Service with accounts you have already established with social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and/or email platforms (e.g., Yahoo! Mail), OneClickSocialLogin will collect the PII as well as other information that you have already provided to the social networking or email platform. This PII may include your name, user name, email address and passwords. Although OneClickSocialLogin won’t use your PII in this manner without your affirmative (“Opt-in”) consent, OneClickSocialLogin may use the information collected this way to analyze the usage of the Service and/or to compile anonymous statistics. In all instances, OneClickSocialLogin obtains and uses this information in accordance with the policies of the social networking or email platform.
When Developers or Clients use the Service and collect PII, OneClickSocialLogin will immediately transfer the PII back to the Developer or Client and cache such PII for a reasonable time, in order to improve the performance of the service. Please note that information collected by such Web Applications is subject to that particular Developer or Client’s privacy policy, and that OneClickSocialLogin is merely facilitating the collection and transfer of the PII in accordance with that privacy policy. OneClickSocialLogin takes reasonable steps to ensure that our Developers and Clients update their privacy policies accordingly.
End Users may be afforded the opportunity to deploy emails via the Service. Where End Users have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent to those email addresses on their behalf. These email addresses will be stored in the address book the OneClickSocialLogin End User creates and will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee. OneClickSocialLogin cautions all End Users to utilize this email functionality in a responsible manner.
2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information
OneClickSocialLogin also collects non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) via the Site and Service. Non-PII is information that may not, on its own, be used to identify or locate a personal or entity, and includes your IP address, browser type, and your computer’s operating system. OneClickSocialLogin collects Non-PII under the following scenarios:

Please note that Web Developers and Clients may also collect Non-PII as it pertains to their Web Applications, and that the information collected by the Service and transferred to Clients and Developers is subject to that particular Developer or Client’s privacy policy. OneClickSocialLogin takes reasonable steps to ensure that our Developers and Clients update their privacy policies accordingly.

This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
